Concerning a projecting part, the same principle holds, for that too will have size, and part of it will project. Indeed, to say this once is equal in force to saying it forever; for no such part of it will be the last, and there will not be a part not extending from another. Thus, if it consists of many parts, it must be both small and huge - so small as not to have size, so huge as to be infinite.
